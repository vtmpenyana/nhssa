		<description><![CDATA[The battle to transform the economy is7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">The battle to transform the economy is becoming fierce, using ambush tactics. Yes, I am talking about Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment. It is common knowledge that the Revised Codes of Good Practice were launched on 2 October 2012. These should have come into effect on 11 October 2013, a date amended to 1 May 2015, effectively giving the market about six months to adjust to the changes. Between the period 2 October 2012 and 30 April 2015 and before this date, in fact as early as late 2011 when signs of adjusting set points to the BEE tool were becoming imminent, comments and opinions about the direction BEE was taking had flooded the media space.</p>
<p class="post-text">Dead Silence!</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">On 1 May 2015, I ran through the internet to search for new commentaries or latest news on BEE. It was dead silence. As a routine that I do in the morning, I searched on 2 May, it was dead silence. I did it on the 3rd and still drew a blank. There seemed to be such tension, so thick it felt like you could slice or cut through it; I guess two giants sizing-up each other &#8211; the State and the Market. Its 5 May 2015, BANG! as if some alien object fell from the sky, the DTI released a statement about the Ownership Element. This effectively throwing &#8220;the cat among the pigeons&#8221; or if you like &#8220;puts a spanner in the works.&#8221; Can you imagine the crisis! The market went bERSERK! I mean cRAZY! aMOK! The Broad Based Ownership Schemes and Employee Share Ownership Schemes were downgraded to only 3 points on the BEE rating scale.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">No sooner had the pen dried on this amendment, another amendment cancelling it is issued by the DTI on 15 May 2015. Whoo! the market breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I have often watched my two cats after feeding and giving them milk, and you see them ambush and size each other up albeit in a playful manner, as if to say thank you Boss (no pun intended), you saved our life! BUT NOW THIS IS SERIOUS! It&#8217;s no cats&#8217; play hey! It touches the very fundamentals of a Society and its State. The question of who owns productive resources is at stake.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">A CLOSER LOOK</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">The pronouncements above show a somewhat interesting picture. Ms Lindiwe Zulu signed the amended statement downgrading the said Ownership schemes on 22 /04/2015, but this statement is released on 05/05/2015. The statement retracting the latter is signed by the Minster of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies on 15/05/2015 and released the same day. Ms Lindiwe Zulu signed in her capacity as an Acting Minister of Trade and Industry. Now, anytime another Minister is acting in place of another it simply means the incumbent is not available. This begs the question was Dr Rob Davies away? Why is the statement signed on 22 April and only released on 5 May? Now that it is withdrawn, is this because the issue was not discussed internally at least? Is there consensus just at the dti in the way in which BEE must unfold? Was this an ambush tactic or was it just an error? What are we to make of this?</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">OPINION<br />
If DTI bowed and succumbed to pressure from the market even before the New Codes started, then this sets a bad precedence of the whole BEE journey ahead. The period between the launch of the Revised Codes and the commencement date of 1 May 2015 gave all parties enough chance to tease out and tweak BEE configurations. It does not make sense to make a major announcement that would impact on the entire BEE Code 4 or 5 days after the effective date. I am saying entire BEE Code because Ownership is one of the priority elements and compulsory; it remains the mainstay of the BEE Act; temper with it and you have tempered with the whole BEE Code. More so because it remains an emotive subject because it determines who controls productive assets of the economy. It is of course going to raise tempers and cause a lot of jitters in the market. So you can&#8217;t introduce the subject in the way DTI has gone about doing it. You have to be methodical, systematic, resolute and steadfast if we should see gains in this area. An ambush tactic is not going to win this war. It has to be upfront, honest and sometimes confrontational. I must by the way reveal my position on the matter of Broad Based Ownership Schemes (BBOS) and Employee Share Ownership Programmes (ESOP&#8217;s) in relation to BEE. Having done BEE audits/ verification, I would recommend that the DTI must come to a point where they phase these out completely. They have no value as ownership instruments, they would rather retain them as a Socio-Economic Development tool, which is what they are. Before we even talk about economic interest that has or has not been paid out to the supposedly intended beneficiaries or investors; let&#8217;s talk about the socio-political and geographical proximity to the measured entity. How does a former miner who used to work on the stopes of a mining company now living in the rural Eastern Cape, former Transkei, perhaps now minding his sheep or even frail from the work in the mining industry that sucked, drained him of his health and sacked him now suddenly owns a stake in that company with its Head offices in Sandton, Johannesburg through some BBOS. How is he going to effect change in systems and practices of that company? How is he going to drive new business thinking? For all I care his aspirations are not even known and don&#8217;t even matter. Better still nobody knows him in the streets of Sandton, much less the corridors of power of the posh affluent corporate office. He is simply known as a statistic which goes something like this &#8211; &#8220;so many black people have invested in our company.&#8221; The points are awarded to the measured entity.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">Yet another question is if ESOP&#8217;s were what they are said to be &#8211; Ownership instruments for employees, why are there so much strikes. Why would the supposedly owners of the business go on strike against their own business demanding decent pay? Why would business owners revolt against their own business leading to the demise of same. Do they not know that they own the entity or are they just stupid? It&#8217;s ludicrous!</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">Another question is how would an employee of the company, now appointed a trustee of the ESOP, which is how these ownership instruments are usually structured, be expected to sit in the boardroom to debate, discourse and meaningfully engage in mapping out the strategic direction of the company with his or her superiors or actual and real owners of the business?</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">In the course of doing these verifications I have personally met companies, usually in the QSE band where these structures have been used to house employee benefits rather than ownership schemes and were claimed to be ownership structures. What is even worse is that verification agencies have awarded points to measured entities despite these dodgy structures. I must say that measured entities are usually assisted by lawyers/ attorneys, accountants, BEE consultants and even verification agencies themselves to establish these quasi ownership structures or outright bogus outfits.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">So the DTI must consult the market on changing the model of ownership measurement but with one resolve and that is to phase out the BBOS and ESOP. They should possibly look at giving the market, realistically, 3 to 5 years after which they should go full steam ahead to change the face of ownership of the factors of production in South Africa. I would even suggest a reducing balance method in allocating points to phase out the process.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">DTI should rather consider strengthening cooperatives as broad based ownership structures. These are more legitimate with clear and traceable flow-through notion of voting rights and economic interest.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">The argument about scrapping of the current form of ownership leading to a proliferation of fronting, which I admit will happen, is neither here nor there. It is as good as saying don&#8217;t make anymore laws because they will lead to more criminals. Just as good laws need the backing of a strong police force, BEE laws will need a strong verification/audit component to police the system. I am just not sure that this exists with the current dispensation of verification/ audit regime as we have it now. This is the weakest link in the BEE chain irrespective of the principal SANAS or IRBA. We need a robust, watertight verification/ audit system if we are hoping for any gains by 2030.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Black Economic Empowerment cannot only be viewed7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">Black Economic Empowerment cannot only be viewed as a social contract but a <i>business case.</i></p>
<p class="post-text">When I started studying basic statistics I found the course/module interesting as it explained the mean, median and mode, the standard deviation and outliers. However the chapter on the normal distribution curve was extremely fascinating and the lecturer went on to explain that this measured all human variables. How &#8220;on point&#8221; this was!</p>
<p class="post-text">Seen through a statistical microscope Black Economic Empowerment cannot escape statistical explanations and extrapolations.</p>
<p class="post-text">If you consider a breakdown of numbers according to the 2011 census you will soon realise that the African majority which bore the brunt of the colonial past, apartheid regime and even after the inauguration of the tricameral parliament in South Africa between 1984 to 1994 form just over 79% of the population. BEE candidates according to the Codes of Good Practice will form over 90.2% of the population of South Africa if you factor in the Chinese Community that qualifies as BEE candidates after they won a court battle in 2008. Surely the exclusion of such a significant number of participants in the economic strata of the country was suicidal, not only from a political point of view but also from an economic viewpoint.</p>
<p class="post-text">The advent of democracy in 1994 meant a paradigm shift for the country and that choices to bolster the economy and take it out of the doldrums must be engineered and not least the advent of Black Economic Empowerment was, inter alia, the result. How else could a Nation that had wasted between 79% and just over 90% of its brain power rescue itself out of an economic dilemma that it had locked itself in for years other than creating means for its other players and participants to be involved. Talking about <i>brain power</i> it suddenly dawns to me that South Africa was using just about 10% of its brain power. Can you imagine a human being using that percent of their brain when the rest has fallen into disuse &#8211; it could be a disaster! No wonder the country was functioning and producing at less than optimum levels not only as a political entity only but an economic whole too.</p>
<p class="post-text">It is reported that South Africa&#8217;s real economic growth rate averaged 0.8% with a per capita growth of negative (-)1.3% between 1985 and 1994. In the year 1995 and 2004 this had turned the tide with an average GDP of 3.2% and per capita rates of 1.1%. This perhaps not a significant improvement and not anything to write home about but nonetheless an economic upswing. This trajectory was at the back of what one calls a consumption economy, fuelled by improved disposable incomes as a result of the deliberate creation of the so called Black Middle Class in South Africa by simply including the majority of its people in the mainstream economy and making them play a meaningful role through the pillars of BEE, especially Management Control and Employment Equity and to a lesser extent Preferential Procurement. It is reported that the increased spending by households (from 1,5% p.a. in 1985 – 1994 to 3,7% in 1995 – 2004) was supported by steady growth in real disposable income (4.4% p.a. in 1995 – 2004). (Economic growth in South Africa since 1994 Stan du Plessis and Ben Smit1) Stellenbosch Economic Working Papers : 1 / 2006. Detractors and advocates of Black Economic Empowerment agree that the exclusion of a certain sector of the citizenry of the country was detrimental to both the political stability of the country and its economic state of being. They however differ on how the correction or redress should be done. In the absence of a proposed solution by detractors of BEE I couldn&#8217;t possible conceive that they are suggesting that such redress should be left to the market forces. The latter has proved many times to have imperfections in even regulating economic cycles and that some human intervention must trigger movements towards the desired and intended direction. How much more with a mechanical system that was designed and orchestrated by human ingenuity to relegate part of its population to the fringes and periphery of economic activity. This could not be left to the invisible hand to regulate.</p>
<p class="post-text">I have listened to debates in the run-up to the 2014 elections and no party has been vocal about how they would include previously disadvantaged South Africans except the EFF and I am no supporter of the EFF. The voter could have thought &#8220;We know what the ruling party&#8217;s stance is on this matter; but what about other parties?&#8221; On par with creating an excellent service delivery machinery in South Africa, economic redistributing and/ or an equitable distribution of her resources remains an item on the agenda and a hot potato. This should probably explain why parties calling for a sunset clause on BEE or those that were silent or not vocal or just not convincing on the matter made a poor showing during the elections.</p>
<p class="post-text">I guess the point I am making is BEE cannot be wished away if it is true that the country suffered inequality under the apartheid system throwing out of the mainstream economy 90% of its resource component. Am I suggesting that it is the best model of empowerment? The answer is NO; it is fraught with flaws, imperfections and inconsistencies and these will be discussed in the next article.</p>
<p class="post-text">I therefore make a proposition that <i>population distributions</i> in South Africa are a reflection of <i>economic/income distributions</i> and if plotted on a normal distribution curve will show skewed realities of the curve to the left and that every effort should be made to skew the graph to the right. It is hoped that the new Ministry of Small Business Development will take a fresh look at this matter and tackle it with renewed vigour if the country must succeed in growing its economy and meet its employment targets.</p>
