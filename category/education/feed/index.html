		<description><![CDATA[The gini coefficient in South Africa is7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">The <i>gini coefficient</i> in South Africa is reported to be 0.70, showing a gap that has widened from a baseline of 0.60 in 1993 to 0.68 in 2000 and 0.70 in 2008. [accessed from Leibbrandt, M. et al. (2010), “Trends in South African Income Distribution and Poverty since the Fall of Apartheid”, OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers, No. 101, OECD Publishing. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kmms0t7p1ms-en/">http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kmms0t7p1ms-en</a>].</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 class="post-bloquote-title">&#8220;The <span style="color: #ffcc00;">gini coefficient</span> is a measure of economic inequality and the registered coefficient in 2008 is a far cry from creating an equitable society, let alone an egalitarian society.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">The originator of the article does not for a moment and by any stretch of imagination or long short think that BEE will deliver an egalitarian society, but concedes that it must bring about a society that not only subscribes to the values of equality and equity but practises these values. In my view this is the difference between an egalitarian society, a utopia and a pipe dream, and a society that upholds ideals of an equitable sharing of resources and wealth of its state.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffcc00; font-size: 20px;">The BIG question is: </span> Can BEE deliver on this noble ideal?</p>
<p class="post-text">The BEE Act is neutral just like money is neutral and will not harm anyone BUT &#8220;The love of money&#8221; may hurt people or individuals. So, it is how people respond to money that elicits a reaction for or against and not money itself. Problems with BEE are not endogenous or inherent within the Act itself but are imported and are a result of practitioners, companies &#8211; Measured Entities/ME&#8217;s, BEE Consultants and Verification Agencies (VA&#8217;s) who collude and attempt to manipulate the Act to suit narrow and selfish interests. This is usually called circumventing the Codes, simply put &#8211; Fronting &#8211; and this is rife in the BEE community.<br />
The story of Enron and Andersen in the US that culminated to the demise of these two giants on 2 Dec 2002 mirrors how things can go wrong in the BEE Verification/Audit space.<br />
&#8220;Andersen&#8217;s failures at Enron were the culmination of a decade of sliding standards and audit debacles at the firm, which had come to reward salesmanship over technical skill and to pursue higher profits even if it meant compromising a legacy of defiant independence.<br />
When outsiders learned the details of Enron&#8217;s dealmaking, its highflying stock plummeted. By the time the energy trader imploded last fall after admitting it overstated earnings by hundreds of millions of dollars, Andersen had little defence, since its signature was all over the deals.&#8221; [accessed 17/11/14; <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0209030210sep03-story.html#page=1" target="_blank">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi- 0209030210sep03-story.html</a>].</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">Perhaps not to the same degree, scale, extent and colossal proportions, the case study above depicts, resembles and highlights a relationship between VA&#8217;s and their Client&#8217;s in the B-BBEE space in South Africa.<br />
The Verification Agency signs on the client and becomes part of its order book. There is obviously an agency-client relationship that exists, 1) because money has changed hands but 2) because the client signed on happens to be one of &#8220;our own folk/ buddy&#8221;. How then do you expect any penalties to be metered out by the VA towards its client in the event there were suspicious issues of fronting? The agency is usually going to point out the mess if too glaring and show the client how to fix it and make this look neat on a piece of paper and then award a level and sign off the certificate. The company/ ME will go on to pitch and tender for business with that certificate. Who will question the authenticity of the certificate again, more especially if issued on the SANAS logo?</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">BEE can and is being manipulated by unscrupulous players that engage in collusive behaviour to outwit and circumvent the Codes. What is interesting is that a VA involved in such collusive behaviour advertently or inadvertently, overt or covert will outsmart SANAS officials during audits and the latter will keep renewing the registration of such a VA year in and year out, at best wittingly or unwittingly perpetuating the problem and at worst colluding with such a VA knowingly or unknowingly. Here is a first-hand experience at the coalface of BEE verification. The agency I worked for was due for a 5 year review by SANAS, shortly before I left. SANAS would then ask for a sampling frame i.e. a list from which they would draw their sample. What the office did and I was not part of this exercise because I never would have been asked to be part of it, due to my stance and views about BEE verification known in the office by everyone including the CEO. The office cleaned its sampling frame more like cleaning an academic record of a student i.e. not to show fail, but pass only to show; gave this to SANAS; dumped all files that could have possibly led to the VA closing down in a small store-room that was hidden away. Of cause the &#8220;random sampling&#8221; by SANAS officials from the &#8220;clean slate&#8221; still picked up audit queries which apparently threw SANAS officials in a tailspin among themselves and debating about withdrawing the accreditation on not. I dare that say the latter is the case as the same VA is still issuing certificates.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I therefore submit that Fronting or Circumvention of the Codes is a pandemic that requires a systems overhaul in dealing with BEE verification/ audit. It needs new thinking and a paradigm shift altogether. I also doubt that a clinical paper trail and unquestionable audit result would be any better if this was to be given to Accounting Firms and Auditors nor to Law Firms. I further postulate that the hypothesis as above in the form of the question &#8220;Can BEE deliver on this noble ideal&#8221; cannot be achieved if the status quo remains in the BEE verification industry. I also wish to emphasize the point that simply moving the task of BEE audit to the Audit Firms is not taking away the risk but only tinkering with the system, for reasons advanced above.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I have often suggested to colleagues when we engage in this discourse that any real and meaningful change in BEE will occur the day Government decides to open up a department to do BEE verification in it itself rather than delegating this to the market. Transformation is too important and critical a task to be left to the market and market forces. Having worked for a VA as a BEE analyst, I uncovered impediments as stated above that will make BEE unsuccessful and not least deliberate circumvention of the Codes/ fronting by verification agencies in collusion with their clients to obtain a better procurement recognition level. This as I have often said just puts the brakes on transforming the entire structure of the SA economy and should really be construed as &#8220;obstruction of justice&#8221; or &#8220;defeating the ends of justice&#8221;.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I therefore propose that Government should take over the BEE verification task and consider various forms and shapes this could take. I already suggest that the scope of the impending B-BBEE Commission be extended so that the task of BEE verification/ audit and issuing of certificates resides within the Commission rather than monitoring and evaluation which is and afterthought post-mortem process and mop-up operation, that is, appear on the scene when damage is already done &#8211; fire fighting/ putting out fires, rather than preventing same from occurring in the first place. I therefore argue for a total and integrated quality management system that builds in watertight quality components into the BEE verification/ audit process rather a process that inspects in quality as an aftermath of the event. If the Commission will adopt the latter they might find themselves inundated and spread themselves too thinly and may soon realize that the magnitude of the problem is beyond their capacity and scope to manage precisely because of its magnitude.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">An inference or conclusion can be drawn from the above that circumvention of Codes is not just isolated incidents nor does it occur here and there but a systemic and systematic problem that occurs on an industry wide scale. I therefore contend that if we must register milestones and make gains this time round in facilitating a meaningful participation of Black people in the economy of the country over the next 5 years and beyond, then a business-process re- engineering approach and wholesale change should be introduced into the BEE verification/ audit space, otherwise this remains the weakest link in achieving developmental goals on the country.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Black Economic Empowerment cannot only be viewed7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">Black Economic Empowerment cannot only be viewed as a social contract but a <i>business case.</i></p>
<p class="post-text">When I started studying basic statistics I found the course/module interesting as it explained the mean, median and mode, the standard deviation and outliers. However the chapter on the normal distribution curve was extremely fascinating and the lecturer went on to explain that this measured all human variables. How &#8220;on point&#8221; this was!</p>
<p class="post-text">Seen through a statistical microscope Black Economic Empowerment cannot escape statistical explanations and extrapolations.</p>
<p class="post-text">If you consider a breakdown of numbers according to the 2011 census you will soon realise that the African majority which bore the brunt of the colonial past, apartheid regime and even after the inauguration of the tricameral parliament in South Africa between 1984 to 1994 form just over 79% of the population. BEE candidates according to the Codes of Good Practice will form over 90.2% of the population of South Africa if you factor in the Chinese Community that qualifies as BEE candidates after they won a court battle in 2008. Surely the exclusion of such a significant number of participants in the economic strata of the country was suicidal, not only from a political point of view but also from an economic viewpoint.</p>
<p class="post-text">The advent of democracy in 1994 meant a paradigm shift for the country and that choices to bolster the economy and take it out of the doldrums must be engineered and not least the advent of Black Economic Empowerment was, inter alia, the result. How else could a Nation that had wasted between 79% and just over 90% of its brain power rescue itself out of an economic dilemma that it had locked itself in for years other than creating means for its other players and participants to be involved. Talking about <i>brain power</i> it suddenly dawns to me that South Africa was using just about 10% of its brain power. Can you imagine a human being using that percent of their brain when the rest has fallen into disuse &#8211; it could be a disaster! No wonder the country was functioning and producing at less than optimum levels not only as a political entity only but an economic whole too.</p>
<p class="post-text">It is reported that South Africa&#8217;s real economic growth rate averaged 0.8% with a per capita growth of negative (-)1.3% between 1985 and 1994. In the year 1995 and 2004 this had turned the tide with an average GDP of 3.2% and per capita rates of 1.1%. This perhaps not a significant improvement and not anything to write home about but nonetheless an economic upswing. This trajectory was at the back of what one calls a consumption economy, fuelled by improved disposable incomes as a result of the deliberate creation of the so called Black Middle Class in South Africa by simply including the majority of its people in the mainstream economy and making them play a meaningful role through the pillars of BEE, especially Management Control and Employment Equity and to a lesser extent Preferential Procurement. It is reported that the increased spending by households (from 1,5% p.a. in 1985 – 1994 to 3,7% in 1995 – 2004) was supported by steady growth in real disposable income (4.4% p.a. in 1995 – 2004). (Economic growth in South Africa since 1994 Stan du Plessis and Ben Smit1) Stellenbosch Economic Working Papers : 1 / 2006. Detractors and advocates of Black Economic Empowerment agree that the exclusion of a certain sector of the citizenry of the country was detrimental to both the political stability of the country and its economic state of being. They however differ on how the correction or redress should be done. In the absence of a proposed solution by detractors of BEE I couldn&#8217;t possible conceive that they are suggesting that such redress should be left to the market forces. The latter has proved many times to have imperfections in even regulating economic cycles and that some human intervention must trigger movements towards the desired and intended direction. How much more with a mechanical system that was designed and orchestrated by human ingenuity to relegate part of its population to the fringes and periphery of economic activity. This could not be left to the invisible hand to regulate.</p>
<p class="post-text">I have listened to debates in the run-up to the 2014 elections and no party has been vocal about how they would include previously disadvantaged South Africans except the EFF and I am no supporter of the EFF. The voter could have thought &#8220;We know what the ruling party&#8217;s stance is on this matter; but what about other parties?&#8221; On par with creating an excellent service delivery machinery in South Africa, economic redistributing and/ or an equitable distribution of her resources remains an item on the agenda and a hot potato. This should probably explain why parties calling for a sunset clause on BEE or those that were silent or not vocal or just not convincing on the matter made a poor showing during the elections.</p>
<p class="post-text">I guess the point I am making is BEE cannot be wished away if it is true that the country suffered inequality under the apartheid system throwing out of the mainstream economy 90% of its resource component. Am I suggesting that it is the best model of empowerment? The answer is NO; it is fraught with flaws, imperfections and inconsistencies and these will be discussed in the next article.</p>
<p class="post-text">I therefore make a proposition that <i>population distributions</i> in South Africa are a reflection of <i>economic/income distributions</i> and if plotted on a normal distribution curve will show skewed realities of the curve to the left and that every effort should be made to skew the graph to the right. It is hoped that the new Ministry of Small Business Development will take a fresh look at this matter and tackle it with renewed vigour if the country must succeed in growing its economy and meet its employment targets.</p>
