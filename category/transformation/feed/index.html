		<description><![CDATA[The battle to transform the economy is7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">The battle to transform the economy is becoming fierce, using ambush tactics. Yes, I am talking about Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment. It is common knowledge that the Revised Codes of Good Practice were launched on 2 October 2012. These should have come into effect on 11 October 2013, a date amended to 1 May 2015, effectively giving the market about six months to adjust to the changes. Between the period 2 October 2012 and 30 April 2015 and before this date, in fact as early as late 2011 when signs of adjusting set points to the BEE tool were becoming imminent, comments and opinions about the direction BEE was taking had flooded the media space.</p>
<p class="post-text">Dead Silence!</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">On 1 May 2015, I ran through the internet to search for new commentaries or latest news on BEE. It was dead silence. As a routine that I do in the morning, I searched on 2 May, it was dead silence. I did it on the 3rd and still drew a blank. There seemed to be such tension, so thick it felt like you could slice or cut through it; I guess two giants sizing-up each other &#8211; the State and the Market. Its 5 May 2015, BANG! as if some alien object fell from the sky, the DTI released a statement about the Ownership Element. This effectively throwing &#8220;the cat among the pigeons&#8221; or if you like &#8220;puts a spanner in the works.&#8221; Can you imagine the crisis! The market went bERSERK! I mean cRAZY! aMOK! The Broad Based Ownership Schemes and Employee Share Ownership Schemes were downgraded to only 3 points on the BEE rating scale.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">No sooner had the pen dried on this amendment, another amendment cancelling it is issued by the DTI on 15 May 2015. Whoo! the market breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I have often watched my two cats after feeding and giving them milk, and you see them ambush and size each other up albeit in a playful manner, as if to say thank you Boss (no pun intended), you saved our life! BUT NOW THIS IS SERIOUS! It&#8217;s no cats&#8217; play hey! It touches the very fundamentals of a Society and its State. The question of who owns productive resources is at stake.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">A CLOSER LOOK</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">The pronouncements above show a somewhat interesting picture. Ms Lindiwe Zulu signed the amended statement downgrading the said Ownership schemes on 22 /04/2015, but this statement is released on 05/05/2015. The statement retracting the latter is signed by the Minster of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies on 15/05/2015 and released the same day. Ms Lindiwe Zulu signed in her capacity as an Acting Minister of Trade and Industry. Now, anytime another Minister is acting in place of another it simply means the incumbent is not available. This begs the question was Dr Rob Davies away? Why is the statement signed on 22 April and only released on 5 May? Now that it is withdrawn, is this because the issue was not discussed internally at least? Is there consensus just at the dti in the way in which BEE must unfold? Was this an ambush tactic or was it just an error? What are we to make of this?</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">OPINION<br />
If DTI bowed and succumbed to pressure from the market even before the New Codes started, then this sets a bad precedence of the whole BEE journey ahead. The period between the launch of the Revised Codes and the commencement date of 1 May 2015 gave all parties enough chance to tease out and tweak BEE configurations. It does not make sense to make a major announcement that would impact on the entire BEE Code 4 or 5 days after the effective date. I am saying entire BEE Code because Ownership is one of the priority elements and compulsory; it remains the mainstay of the BEE Act; temper with it and you have tempered with the whole BEE Code. More so because it remains an emotive subject because it determines who controls productive assets of the economy. It is of course going to raise tempers and cause a lot of jitters in the market. So you can&#8217;t introduce the subject in the way DTI has gone about doing it. You have to be methodical, systematic, resolute and steadfast if we should see gains in this area. An ambush tactic is not going to win this war. It has to be upfront, honest and sometimes confrontational. I must by the way reveal my position on the matter of Broad Based Ownership Schemes (BBOS) and Employee Share Ownership Programmes (ESOP&#8217;s) in relation to BEE. Having done BEE audits/ verification, I would recommend that the DTI must come to a point where they phase these out completely. They have no value as ownership instruments, they would rather retain them as a Socio-Economic Development tool, which is what they are. Before we even talk about economic interest that has or has not been paid out to the supposedly intended beneficiaries or investors; let&#8217;s talk about the socio-political and geographical proximity to the measured entity. How does a former miner who used to work on the stopes of a mining company now living in the rural Eastern Cape, former Transkei, perhaps now minding his sheep or even frail from the work in the mining industry that sucked, drained him of his health and sacked him now suddenly owns a stake in that company with its Head offices in Sandton, Johannesburg through some BBOS. How is he going to effect change in systems and practices of that company? How is he going to drive new business thinking? For all I care his aspirations are not even known and don&#8217;t even matter. Better still nobody knows him in the streets of Sandton, much less the corridors of power of the posh affluent corporate office. He is simply known as a statistic which goes something like this &#8211; &#8220;so many black people have invested in our company.&#8221; The points are awarded to the measured entity.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">Yet another question is if ESOP&#8217;s were what they are said to be &#8211; Ownership instruments for employees, why are there so much strikes. Why would the supposedly owners of the business go on strike against their own business demanding decent pay? Why would business owners revolt against their own business leading to the demise of same. Do they not know that they own the entity or are they just stupid? It&#8217;s ludicrous!</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">Another question is how would an employee of the company, now appointed a trustee of the ESOP, which is how these ownership instruments are usually structured, be expected to sit in the boardroom to debate, discourse and meaningfully engage in mapping out the strategic direction of the company with his or her superiors or actual and real owners of the business?</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">In the course of doing these verifications I have personally met companies, usually in the QSE band where these structures have been used to house employee benefits rather than ownership schemes and were claimed to be ownership structures. What is even worse is that verification agencies have awarded points to measured entities despite these dodgy structures. I must say that measured entities are usually assisted by lawyers/ attorneys, accountants, BEE consultants and even verification agencies themselves to establish these quasi ownership structures or outright bogus outfits.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">So the DTI must consult the market on changing the model of ownership measurement but with one resolve and that is to phase out the BBOS and ESOP. They should possibly look at giving the market, realistically, 3 to 5 years after which they should go full steam ahead to change the face of ownership of the factors of production in South Africa. I would even suggest a reducing balance method in allocating points to phase out the process.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">DTI should rather consider strengthening cooperatives as broad based ownership structures. These are more legitimate with clear and traceable flow-through notion of voting rights and economic interest.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">The argument about scrapping of the current form of ownership leading to a proliferation of fronting, which I admit will happen, is neither here nor there. It is as good as saying don&#8217;t make anymore laws because they will lead to more criminals. Just as good laws need the backing of a strong police force, BEE laws will need a strong verification/audit component to police the system. I am just not sure that this exists with the current dispensation of verification/ audit regime as we have it now. This is the weakest link in the BEE chain irrespective of the principal SANAS or IRBA. We need a robust, watertight verification/ audit system if we are hoping for any gains by 2030.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Implementation of the NDP seems to be7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">Implementation of the NDP seems to be hampered by many obstacles and not least by the dissenting voice of the ultra left politics &#8211; Numsa and the EFF. A conference I attended where an EFF central member articulated their opposed view to the NDP on the basis that its economic premise and fundamentals were flawed and that is, the fact that a pre-condition or pre-requisite to the success of the plan is that the economy should be growing at 5%. The delegate further insinuated that the NDP was a useless document and that the country will wait until 2030 and nothing would have changed. Well, I had not quite read the NDP except for excerpts and commentaries prior to the conference and I was almost convinced that indeed the sum did not add up. This view by the said delegate made me to go and read the NDP and go through it with a fine tooth comb. Having critiqued the document and done an appraisal of same, I am convinced that the explicit and implied message in the document recognises that the GDP yield will be different each year and that an average over the 20 year period from 2011 should be 5.4%. This is not rocket science at all; anybody who has done basic Statistics would acknowledge that the average is the sum of all GDP scores over the entire 20 years divided by the number of years. One can only conclude therefore that the said delegate was either deliberately misleading a group of ignorant professionals including myself or he himself had not done his homework properly which would on its own be an indictment as the said delegate is a respected professional. However this is neither here nor there and it is besides the point that I want to drive home in this discussion.</p>
<p class="post-text">Numsa has also articulated its views and I make a supposition that the rejection of the NDP from that front is its proposal of reviews and adjustments to the labour relations landscape, inter alia, which seems to be advocating for business interests over those of workers, a move which could leave workers high and dry and in a lurch, eroding labour relation gains since the dawn of democracy.</p>
<p class="post-text">These aversions to the document beg the question, who are the architects and engineers of the NDP. One would have thought that business, labour, government and society at some forum, NEDLAC, if it still exists, or something, participated in the conceptualisation, scoping, brainstorming and finally charting the course for the country and the production of the final product, the NDP. If such a consultative process did not take place, how could anybody think that the uptake of the final product would be a logical step? If such a consultative process did not occur, further questions would ensue such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the engineers of the NDP?</li>
<li>What are their interests?</li>
<li>Who are the stakeholders and interest groups?</li>
</ul>
<p class="post-text">If answers are not adequately provided, then an impression that technocrats and bureaucrats produced the document becomes inevitable. If that perception is correct, then a further question arises, why did the ANC recall Thabo Mbeki as the President of the Country because among other matters raised when he was recalled was his economic policy -GEAR, allegedly designed by technocrats and bureaucrats. If again this is not answered comprehensively, further questions must be asked: What policy shifts and fundamental change has the present administration effected, that is a noticeable departure from the previous administration, apart from rolling out the HIV/AIDS programme, which I commend it for, and again introducing new departments, hopefully to give focus to its programmes of action and of course under new faces &#8211; Ministers and MEC&#8217;s and tinker with the system and tweak programmes here and there. I may add here that I find it funny that a specific Minister who was not appointed a government Minister at the time of the previous administration, was chopping government left, right and centre but now that the same individual has become Minister &#8216;serving government at the pleasure of the President&#8217; has become the number one fan and supporter of government and yet no significant and noticeable change of policy from the previous administration. Makes you wonder sometimes if politics is not about idiosyncrasies and personal egos and sometimes downright tribal and ethnic issues manifesting, camouflaging, disguising and playing out themselves as ideological and political differences. Let me further make a note that the previous administration was criticized of what others referred to as a &#8216;Xhosa Nostra&#8217;, which apparently had developed in the ranks of government. Consequently silent debates on the fringes of mainstream political discourse and policy issues in the build up to the ANC 52nd National Conference in Polokwane in 2007 included purging the country of this scourge. Perception or reality, if such practice existed within the ranks of government, as is corruption, that should have been removed &#8216;without flinching or blinking an eye&#8217;. It is, however, interesting that the present administration is accused of the Zulu hegemony, again a silent debate on the fringes of mainstream politics. A module In Marketing Communications covers design appeals and here you will soon learn about egoistic and altruistic appeals and I think that if my suspicion above is correct, then these individuals have mastered the art of converting selfish interest to pose as the interests of the majority. We must as a country always guard against sliding into George Orwell&#8217;s [Eric Arthur Blair] satire &#8211; The Animal Farm because of human follies and unbridled human desires, tendencies and selfish ambitions that can sacrifice human virtues at the altar of political expediency and convenience. Well, that is my bit to Nation Building. Back to the point!</p>
<p class="post-text">The point was that I find NDP a reasonably document and charting the course for a future that we all aspire and hope for as a Nation. There are however parts of it that are unrealistic and these must be engaged with to make adjustments and to bring the broader and divergent stakeholder interests to a convergence point and thereafter go full steam ahead to implement the document. Practising in the BEE space I do recognise that some of the changes in the Revised BEE Codes [RCoGP] are informed by this document, a nobly and plausibly move by the dti for being pro-active and decisive, extrapolating and implementing these recommendations already to take the country forward. However I must warn, as I always do, that without new systems to police the BEE verification process, very little if any will change by 2030 in the BEE space and, of course, the structural impediments in the entire South African Economy will remain the same if ownership patterns of the means of production and capital do not alter and / or are not tampered with radically. The BEE verification component is an integral and pivotal part of that change but ironically it is the weakest link in the system and if no attention is paid to it, it will erode any gains intended by this piece of legislation &#8211; the BEE Act.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The gini coefficient in South Africa is7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">The <i>gini coefficient</i> in South Africa is reported to be 0.70, showing a gap that has widened from a baseline of 0.60 in 1993 to 0.68 in 2000 and 0.70 in 2008. [accessed from Leibbrandt, M. et al. (2010), “Trends in South African Income Distribution and Poverty since the Fall of Apartheid”, OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers, No. 101, OECD Publishing. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kmms0t7p1ms-en/">http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kmms0t7p1ms-en</a>].</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 class="post-bloquote-title">&#8220;The <span style="color: #ffcc00;">gini coefficient</span> is a measure of economic inequality and the registered coefficient in 2008 is a far cry from creating an equitable society, let alone an egalitarian society.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">The originator of the article does not for a moment and by any stretch of imagination or long short think that BEE will deliver an egalitarian society, but concedes that it must bring about a society that not only subscribes to the values of equality and equity but practises these values. In my view this is the difference between an egalitarian society, a utopia and a pipe dream, and a society that upholds ideals of an equitable sharing of resources and wealth of its state.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffcc00; font-size: 20px;">The BIG question is: </span> Can BEE deliver on this noble ideal?</p>
<p class="post-text">The BEE Act is neutral just like money is neutral and will not harm anyone BUT &#8220;The love of money&#8221; may hurt people or individuals. So, it is how people respond to money that elicits a reaction for or against and not money itself. Problems with BEE are not endogenous or inherent within the Act itself but are imported and are a result of practitioners, companies &#8211; Measured Entities/ME&#8217;s, BEE Consultants and Verification Agencies (VA&#8217;s) who collude and attempt to manipulate the Act to suit narrow and selfish interests. This is usually called circumventing the Codes, simply put &#8211; Fronting &#8211; and this is rife in the BEE community.<br />
The story of Enron and Andersen in the US that culminated to the demise of these two giants on 2 Dec 2002 mirrors how things can go wrong in the BEE Verification/Audit space.<br />
&#8220;Andersen&#8217;s failures at Enron were the culmination of a decade of sliding standards and audit debacles at the firm, which had come to reward salesmanship over technical skill and to pursue higher profits even if it meant compromising a legacy of defiant independence.<br />
When outsiders learned the details of Enron&#8217;s dealmaking, its highflying stock plummeted. By the time the energy trader imploded last fall after admitting it overstated earnings by hundreds of millions of dollars, Andersen had little defence, since its signature was all over the deals.&#8221; [accessed 17/11/14; <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0209030210sep03-story.html#page=1" target="_blank">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi- 0209030210sep03-story.html</a>].</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">Perhaps not to the same degree, scale, extent and colossal proportions, the case study above depicts, resembles and highlights a relationship between VA&#8217;s and their Client&#8217;s in the B-BBEE space in South Africa.<br />
The Verification Agency signs on the client and becomes part of its order book. There is obviously an agency-client relationship that exists, 1) because money has changed hands but 2) because the client signed on happens to be one of &#8220;our own folk/ buddy&#8221;. How then do you expect any penalties to be metered out by the VA towards its client in the event there were suspicious issues of fronting? The agency is usually going to point out the mess if too glaring and show the client how to fix it and make this look neat on a piece of paper and then award a level and sign off the certificate. The company/ ME will go on to pitch and tender for business with that certificate. Who will question the authenticity of the certificate again, more especially if issued on the SANAS logo?</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">BEE can and is being manipulated by unscrupulous players that engage in collusive behaviour to outwit and circumvent the Codes. What is interesting is that a VA involved in such collusive behaviour advertently or inadvertently, overt or covert will outsmart SANAS officials during audits and the latter will keep renewing the registration of such a VA year in and year out, at best wittingly or unwittingly perpetuating the problem and at worst colluding with such a VA knowingly or unknowingly. Here is a first-hand experience at the coalface of BEE verification. The agency I worked for was due for a 5 year review by SANAS, shortly before I left. SANAS would then ask for a sampling frame i.e. a list from which they would draw their sample. What the office did and I was not part of this exercise because I never would have been asked to be part of it, due to my stance and views about BEE verification known in the office by everyone including the CEO. The office cleaned its sampling frame more like cleaning an academic record of a student i.e. not to show fail, but pass only to show; gave this to SANAS; dumped all files that could have possibly led to the VA closing down in a small store-room that was hidden away. Of cause the &#8220;random sampling&#8221; by SANAS officials from the &#8220;clean slate&#8221; still picked up audit queries which apparently threw SANAS officials in a tailspin among themselves and debating about withdrawing the accreditation on not. I dare that say the latter is the case as the same VA is still issuing certificates.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I therefore submit that Fronting or Circumvention of the Codes is a pandemic that requires a systems overhaul in dealing with BEE verification/ audit. It needs new thinking and a paradigm shift altogether. I also doubt that a clinical paper trail and unquestionable audit result would be any better if this was to be given to Accounting Firms and Auditors nor to Law Firms. I further postulate that the hypothesis as above in the form of the question &#8220;Can BEE deliver on this noble ideal&#8221; cannot be achieved if the status quo remains in the BEE verification industry. I also wish to emphasize the point that simply moving the task of BEE audit to the Audit Firms is not taking away the risk but only tinkering with the system, for reasons advanced above.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I have often suggested to colleagues when we engage in this discourse that any real and meaningful change in BEE will occur the day Government decides to open up a department to do BEE verification in it itself rather than delegating this to the market. Transformation is too important and critical a task to be left to the market and market forces. Having worked for a VA as a BEE analyst, I uncovered impediments as stated above that will make BEE unsuccessful and not least deliberate circumvention of the Codes/ fronting by verification agencies in collusion with their clients to obtain a better procurement recognition level. This as I have often said just puts the brakes on transforming the entire structure of the SA economy and should really be construed as &#8220;obstruction of justice&#8221; or &#8220;defeating the ends of justice&#8221;.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I therefore propose that Government should take over the BEE verification task and consider various forms and shapes this could take. I already suggest that the scope of the impending B-BBEE Commission be extended so that the task of BEE verification/ audit and issuing of certificates resides within the Commission rather than monitoring and evaluation which is and afterthought post-mortem process and mop-up operation, that is, appear on the scene when damage is already done &#8211; fire fighting/ putting out fires, rather than preventing same from occurring in the first place. I therefore argue for a total and integrated quality management system that builds in watertight quality components into the BEE verification/ audit process rather a process that inspects in quality as an aftermath of the event. If the Commission will adopt the latter they might find themselves inundated and spread themselves too thinly and may soon realize that the magnitude of the problem is beyond their capacity and scope to manage precisely because of its magnitude.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">An inference or conclusion can be drawn from the above that circumvention of Codes is not just isolated incidents nor does it occur here and there but a systemic and systematic problem that occurs on an industry wide scale. I therefore contend that if we must register milestones and make gains this time round in facilitating a meaningful participation of Black people in the economy of the country over the next 5 years and beyond, then a business-process re- engineering approach and wholesale change should be introduced into the BEE verification/ audit space, otherwise this remains the weakest link in achieving developmental goals on the country.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">Black Economic Empowerment cannot only be viewed as a social contract but a <i>business case.</i></p>
<p class="post-text">When I started studying basic statistics I found the course/module interesting as it explained the mean, median and mode, the standard deviation and outliers. However the chapter on the normal distribution curve was extremely fascinating and the lecturer went on to explain that this measured all human variables. How &#8220;on point&#8221; this was!</p>
<p class="post-text">Seen through a statistical microscope Black Economic Empowerment cannot escape statistical explanations and extrapolations.</p>
<p class="post-text">If you consider a breakdown of numbers according to the 2011 census you will soon realise that the African majority which bore the brunt of the colonial past, apartheid regime and even after the inauguration of the tricameral parliament in South Africa between 1984 to 1994 form just over 79% of the population. BEE candidates according to the Codes of Good Practice will form over 90.2% of the population of South Africa if you factor in the Chinese Community that qualifies as BEE candidates after they won a court battle in 2008. Surely the exclusion of such a significant number of participants in the economic strata of the country was suicidal, not only from a political point of view but also from an economic viewpoint.</p>
<p class="post-text">The advent of democracy in 1994 meant a paradigm shift for the country and that choices to bolster the economy and take it out of the doldrums must be engineered and not least the advent of Black Economic Empowerment was, inter alia, the result. How else could a Nation that had wasted between 79% and just over 90% of its brain power rescue itself out of an economic dilemma that it had locked itself in for years other than creating means for its other players and participants to be involved. Talking about <i>brain power</i> it suddenly dawns to me that South Africa was using just about 10% of its brain power. Can you imagine a human being using that percent of their brain when the rest has fallen into disuse &#8211; it could be a disaster! No wonder the country was functioning and producing at less than optimum levels not only as a political entity only but an economic whole too.</p>
<p class="post-text">It is reported that South Africa&#8217;s real economic growth rate averaged 0.8% with a per capita growth of negative (-)1.3% between 1985 and 1994. In the year 1995 and 2004 this had turned the tide with an average GDP of 3.2% and per capita rates of 1.1%. This perhaps not a significant improvement and not anything to write home about but nonetheless an economic upswing. This trajectory was at the back of what one calls a consumption economy, fuelled by improved disposable incomes as a result of the deliberate creation of the so called Black Middle Class in South Africa by simply including the majority of its people in the mainstream economy and making them play a meaningful role through the pillars of BEE, especially Management Control and Employment Equity and to a lesser extent Preferential Procurement. It is reported that the increased spending by households (from 1,5% p.a. in 1985 – 1994 to 3,7% in 1995 – 2004) was supported by steady growth in real disposable income (4.4% p.a. in 1995 – 2004). (Economic growth in South Africa since 1994 Stan du Plessis and Ben Smit1) Stellenbosch Economic Working Papers : 1 / 2006. Detractors and advocates of Black Economic Empowerment agree that the exclusion of a certain sector of the citizenry of the country was detrimental to both the political stability of the country and its economic state of being. They however differ on how the correction or redress should be done. In the absence of a proposed solution by detractors of BEE I couldn&#8217;t possible conceive that they are suggesting that such redress should be left to the market forces. The latter has proved many times to have imperfections in even regulating economic cycles and that some human intervention must trigger movements towards the desired and intended direction. How much more with a mechanical system that was designed and orchestrated by human ingenuity to relegate part of its population to the fringes and periphery of economic activity. This could not be left to the invisible hand to regulate.</p>
<p class="post-text">I have listened to debates in the run-up to the 2014 elections and no party has been vocal about how they would include previously disadvantaged South Africans except the EFF and I am no supporter of the EFF. The voter could have thought &#8220;We know what the ruling party&#8217;s stance is on this matter; but what about other parties?&#8221; On par with creating an excellent service delivery machinery in South Africa, economic redistributing and/ or an equitable distribution of her resources remains an item on the agenda and a hot potato. This should probably explain why parties calling for a sunset clause on BEE or those that were silent or not vocal or just not convincing on the matter made a poor showing during the elections.</p>
<p class="post-text">I guess the point I am making is BEE cannot be wished away if it is true that the country suffered inequality under the apartheid system throwing out of the mainstream economy 90% of its resource component. Am I suggesting that it is the best model of empowerment? The answer is NO; it is fraught with flaws, imperfections and inconsistencies and these will be discussed in the next article.</p>
<p class="post-text">I therefore make a proposition that <i>population distributions</i> in South Africa are a reflection of <i>economic/income distributions</i> and if plotted on a normal distribution curve will show skewed realities of the curve to the left and that every effort should be made to skew the graph to the right. It is hoped that the new Ministry of Small Business Development will take a fresh look at this matter and tackle it with renewed vigour if the country must succeed in growing its economy and meet its employment targets.</p>
