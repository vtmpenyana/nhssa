		<description><![CDATA[Implementation of the NDP seems to be7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">Implementation of the NDP seems to be hampered by many obstacles and not least by the dissenting voice of the ultra left politics &#8211; Numsa and the EFF. A conference I attended where an EFF central member articulated their opposed view to the NDP on the basis that its economic premise and fundamentals were flawed and that is, the fact that a pre-condition or pre-requisite to the success of the plan is that the economy should be growing at 5%. The delegate further insinuated that the NDP was a useless document and that the country will wait until 2030 and nothing would have changed. Well, I had not quite read the NDP except for excerpts and commentaries prior to the conference and I was almost convinced that indeed the sum did not add up. This view by the said delegate made me to go and read the NDP and go through it with a fine tooth comb. Having critiqued the document and done an appraisal of same, I am convinced that the explicit and implied message in the document recognises that the GDP yield will be different each year and that an average over the 20 year period from 2011 should be 5.4%. This is not rocket science at all; anybody who has done basic Statistics would acknowledge that the average is the sum of all GDP scores over the entire 20 years divided by the number of years. One can only conclude therefore that the said delegate was either deliberately misleading a group of ignorant professionals including myself or he himself had not done his homework properly which would on its own be an indictment as the said delegate is a respected professional. However this is neither here nor there and it is besides the point that I want to drive home in this discussion.</p>
<p class="post-text">Numsa has also articulated its views and I make a supposition that the rejection of the NDP from that front is its proposal of reviews and adjustments to the labour relations landscape, inter alia, which seems to be advocating for business interests over those of workers, a move which could leave workers high and dry and in a lurch, eroding labour relation gains since the dawn of democracy.</p>
<p class="post-text">These aversions to the document beg the question, who are the architects and engineers of the NDP. One would have thought that business, labour, government and society at some forum, NEDLAC, if it still exists, or something, participated in the conceptualisation, scoping, brainstorming and finally charting the course for the country and the production of the final product, the NDP. If such a consultative process did not take place, how could anybody think that the uptake of the final product would be a logical step? If such a consultative process did not occur, further questions would ensue such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the engineers of the NDP?</li>
<li>What are their interests?</li>
<li>Who are the stakeholders and interest groups?</li>
</ul>
<p class="post-text">If answers are not adequately provided, then an impression that technocrats and bureaucrats produced the document becomes inevitable. If that perception is correct, then a further question arises, why did the ANC recall Thabo Mbeki as the President of the Country because among other matters raised when he was recalled was his economic policy -GEAR, allegedly designed by technocrats and bureaucrats. If again this is not answered comprehensively, further questions must be asked: What policy shifts and fundamental change has the present administration effected, that is a noticeable departure from the previous administration, apart from rolling out the HIV/AIDS programme, which I commend it for, and again introducing new departments, hopefully to give focus to its programmes of action and of course under new faces &#8211; Ministers and MEC&#8217;s and tinker with the system and tweak programmes here and there. I may add here that I find it funny that a specific Minister who was not appointed a government Minister at the time of the previous administration, was chopping government left, right and centre but now that the same individual has become Minister &#8216;serving government at the pleasure of the President&#8217; has become the number one fan and supporter of government and yet no significant and noticeable change of policy from the previous administration. Makes you wonder sometimes if politics is not about idiosyncrasies and personal egos and sometimes downright tribal and ethnic issues manifesting, camouflaging, disguising and playing out themselves as ideological and political differences. Let me further make a note that the previous administration was criticized of what others referred to as a &#8216;Xhosa Nostra&#8217;, which apparently had developed in the ranks of government. Consequently silent debates on the fringes of mainstream political discourse and policy issues in the build up to the ANC 52nd National Conference in Polokwane in 2007 included purging the country of this scourge. Perception or reality, if such practice existed within the ranks of government, as is corruption, that should have been removed &#8216;without flinching or blinking an eye&#8217;. It is, however, interesting that the present administration is accused of the Zulu hegemony, again a silent debate on the fringes of mainstream politics. A module In Marketing Communications covers design appeals and here you will soon learn about egoistic and altruistic appeals and I think that if my suspicion above is correct, then these individuals have mastered the art of converting selfish interest to pose as the interests of the majority. We must as a country always guard against sliding into George Orwell&#8217;s [Eric Arthur Blair] satire &#8211; The Animal Farm because of human follies and unbridled human desires, tendencies and selfish ambitions that can sacrifice human virtues at the altar of political expediency and convenience. Well, that is my bit to Nation Building. Back to the point!</p>
<p class="post-text">The point was that I find NDP a reasonably document and charting the course for a future that we all aspire and hope for as a Nation. There are however parts of it that are unrealistic and these must be engaged with to make adjustments and to bring the broader and divergent stakeholder interests to a convergence point and thereafter go full steam ahead to implement the document. Practising in the BEE space I do recognise that some of the changes in the Revised BEE Codes [RCoGP] are informed by this document, a nobly and plausibly move by the dti for being pro-active and decisive, extrapolating and implementing these recommendations already to take the country forward. However I must warn, as I always do, that without new systems to police the BEE verification process, very little if any will change by 2030 in the BEE space and, of course, the structural impediments in the entire South African Economy will remain the same if ownership patterns of the means of production and capital do not alter and / or are not tampered with radically. The BEE verification component is an integral and pivotal part of that change but ironically it is the weakest link in the system and if no attention is paid to it, it will erode any gains intended by this piece of legislation &#8211; the BEE Act.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The gini coefficient in South Africa is7]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-text">The <i>gini coefficient</i> in South Africa is reported to be 0.70, showing a gap that has widened from a baseline of 0.60 in 1993 to 0.68 in 2000 and 0.70 in 2008. [accessed from Leibbrandt, M. et al. (2010), “Trends in South African Income Distribution and Poverty since the Fall of Apartheid”, OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers, No. 101, OECD Publishing. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kmms0t7p1ms-en/">http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kmms0t7p1ms-en</a>].</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 class="post-bloquote-title">&#8220;The <span style="color: #ffcc00;">gini coefficient</span> is a measure of economic inequality and the registered coefficient in 2008 is a far cry from creating an equitable society, let alone an egalitarian society.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">The originator of the article does not for a moment and by any stretch of imagination or long short think that BEE will deliver an egalitarian society, but concedes that it must bring about a society that not only subscribes to the values of equality and equity but practises these values. In my view this is the difference between an egalitarian society, a utopia and a pipe dream, and a society that upholds ideals of an equitable sharing of resources and wealth of its state.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffcc00; font-size: 20px;">The BIG question is: </span> Can BEE deliver on this noble ideal?</p>
<p class="post-text">The BEE Act is neutral just like money is neutral and will not harm anyone BUT &#8220;The love of money&#8221; may hurt people or individuals. So, it is how people respond to money that elicits a reaction for or against and not money itself. Problems with BEE are not endogenous or inherent within the Act itself but are imported and are a result of practitioners, companies &#8211; Measured Entities/ME&#8217;s, BEE Consultants and Verification Agencies (VA&#8217;s) who collude and attempt to manipulate the Act to suit narrow and selfish interests. This is usually called circumventing the Codes, simply put &#8211; Fronting &#8211; and this is rife in the BEE community.<br />
The story of Enron and Andersen in the US that culminated to the demise of these two giants on 2 Dec 2002 mirrors how things can go wrong in the BEE Verification/Audit space.<br />
&#8220;Andersen&#8217;s failures at Enron were the culmination of a decade of sliding standards and audit debacles at the firm, which had come to reward salesmanship over technical skill and to pursue higher profits even if it meant compromising a legacy of defiant independence.<br />
When outsiders learned the details of Enron&#8217;s dealmaking, its highflying stock plummeted. By the time the energy trader imploded last fall after admitting it overstated earnings by hundreds of millions of dollars, Andersen had little defence, since its signature was all over the deals.&#8221; [accessed 17/11/14; <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0209030210sep03-story.html#page=1" target="_blank">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi- 0209030210sep03-story.html</a>].</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">Perhaps not to the same degree, scale, extent and colossal proportions, the case study above depicts, resembles and highlights a relationship between VA&#8217;s and their Client&#8217;s in the B-BBEE space in South Africa.<br />
The Verification Agency signs on the client and becomes part of its order book. There is obviously an agency-client relationship that exists, 1) because money has changed hands but 2) because the client signed on happens to be one of &#8220;our own folk/ buddy&#8221;. How then do you expect any penalties to be metered out by the VA towards its client in the event there were suspicious issues of fronting? The agency is usually going to point out the mess if too glaring and show the client how to fix it and make this look neat on a piece of paper and then award a level and sign off the certificate. The company/ ME will go on to pitch and tender for business with that certificate. Who will question the authenticity of the certificate again, more especially if issued on the SANAS logo?</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">BEE can and is being manipulated by unscrupulous players that engage in collusive behaviour to outwit and circumvent the Codes. What is interesting is that a VA involved in such collusive behaviour advertently or inadvertently, overt or covert will outsmart SANAS officials during audits and the latter will keep renewing the registration of such a VA year in and year out, at best wittingly or unwittingly perpetuating the problem and at worst colluding with such a VA knowingly or unknowingly. Here is a first-hand experience at the coalface of BEE verification. The agency I worked for was due for a 5 year review by SANAS, shortly before I left. SANAS would then ask for a sampling frame i.e. a list from which they would draw their sample. What the office did and I was not part of this exercise because I never would have been asked to be part of it, due to my stance and views about BEE verification known in the office by everyone including the CEO. The office cleaned its sampling frame more like cleaning an academic record of a student i.e. not to show fail, but pass only to show; gave this to SANAS; dumped all files that could have possibly led to the VA closing down in a small store-room that was hidden away. Of cause the &#8220;random sampling&#8221; by SANAS officials from the &#8220;clean slate&#8221; still picked up audit queries which apparently threw SANAS officials in a tailspin among themselves and debating about withdrawing the accreditation on not. I dare that say the latter is the case as the same VA is still issuing certificates.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I therefore submit that Fronting or Circumvention of the Codes is a pandemic that requires a systems overhaul in dealing with BEE verification/ audit. It needs new thinking and a paradigm shift altogether. I also doubt that a clinical paper trail and unquestionable audit result would be any better if this was to be given to Accounting Firms and Auditors nor to Law Firms. I further postulate that the hypothesis as above in the form of the question &#8220;Can BEE deliver on this noble ideal&#8221; cannot be achieved if the status quo remains in the BEE verification industry. I also wish to emphasize the point that simply moving the task of BEE audit to the Audit Firms is not taking away the risk but only tinkering with the system, for reasons advanced above.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I have often suggested to colleagues when we engage in this discourse that any real and meaningful change in BEE will occur the day Government decides to open up a department to do BEE verification in it itself rather than delegating this to the market. Transformation is too important and critical a task to be left to the market and market forces. Having worked for a VA as a BEE analyst, I uncovered impediments as stated above that will make BEE unsuccessful and not least deliberate circumvention of the Codes/ fronting by verification agencies in collusion with their clients to obtain a better procurement recognition level. This as I have often said just puts the brakes on transforming the entire structure of the SA economy and should really be construed as &#8220;obstruction of justice&#8221; or &#8220;defeating the ends of justice&#8221;.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">I therefore propose that Government should take over the BEE verification task and consider various forms and shapes this could take. I already suggest that the scope of the impending B-BBEE Commission be extended so that the task of BEE verification/ audit and issuing of certificates resides within the Commission rather than monitoring and evaluation which is and afterthought post-mortem process and mop-up operation, that is, appear on the scene when damage is already done &#8211; fire fighting/ putting out fires, rather than preventing same from occurring in the first place. I therefore argue for a total and integrated quality management system that builds in watertight quality components into the BEE verification/ audit process rather a process that inspects in quality as an aftermath of the event. If the Commission will adopt the latter they might find themselves inundated and spread themselves too thinly and may soon realize that the magnitude of the problem is beyond their capacity and scope to manage precisely because of its magnitude.</p>
<p class="post-text" style="text-align: left;">An inference or conclusion can be drawn from the above that circumvention of Codes is not just isolated incidents nor does it occur here and there but a systemic and systematic problem that occurs on an industry wide scale. I therefore contend that if we must register milestones and make gains this time round in facilitating a meaningful participation of Black people in the economy of the country over the next 5 years and beyond, then a business-process re- engineering approach and wholesale change should be introduced into the BEE verification/ audit space, otherwise this remains the weakest link in achieving developmental goals on the country.</p>
